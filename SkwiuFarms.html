				Skwiu Farms is a future non profit 501(c)3 organization
				focused on enriching local communities near to the
				Piedmont and Mountainside of North Carolina through the
				creation of local cooperative markets based in high
				quality, free-range poultry, and organically produce
				grown locally in the nearby area. Skwiu Farms strictly
				adheres to a no synthetics in the garden policy, a non
				GMO policy, and we also focus on bringing foods of the
				native, indigenous Americans to the people in
				communities adjacent to our projects. Skwiu Farms
				implements a hands on philosophy for education and
				outreach, bringing the best of locally grown exotics and
				natives for a bio-diverse diet from our welcoming
				community.

<p>    Skwiu Farms consists of many people from Permaculture designers, artists, jack of all trade types, apprentices, and scientists.  Our unifying force originates in
our shared common interest, which is the common interest to all people; That is, to have flourishing, and abundant food growing nearby to ensure our healthfulness and
prosperity.  Our projects guarantee a mutually beneficial system for the soil microbes and people, and provide carbon sequestration from the atmosphere. We will utilize some known exotic
foods, but focus on maintaining a 60% minimum on native plant species.  Sections of Skwiu farms are allotted for the conservation of native plants, and
restoring the populations of native, and exotic, endangered plants.  We expect and openly welcome scientific researchers who want to study these plants, the soil,
and videographers or artists who want to document our experiences. We do not discriminate based on anything, however we expect that regardless of your age, you will
be able to find productive ways to work, teach, and share.</p>


<p>Our website is a platform through which people can understand more about what we do, or who wish to contact our organization to arrange for accommodations for those staying or visiting.
We hope that you will visit our links for our data, and suggest exotic plants for conservation, as well as native plants (that perhaps
we've missed or not gotten to yet), so that we have an easier time keeping open documentation of our progress.  We will be using the Google Drive, for most of our documents, and therefore
need only the capability to cross platform the links from our Google Drive onto the page, either displayed, or linked to.  We will be keeping live documentation on the 
Internet of our inventory, growing and in seed, as well as notes about the growing progress, any pitfalls, and easy growing species that should be noted, with progress
on the account of restoration of endangered species' populations.</p>

		<h4>Special Thanks</h4>
		<p> Without the Internet, and the pioneers of scientific advancement, SKWIU farms would not ever be able to exist.  We believe that all information should be shared,
		and we thank those whom we have learned from, whether it be through a personal relationship, books, or other documentation of existing and historical projects within
		ecological restoration, permaculture, agriculture, forestry, and all related facets of natural exploration for human and environmental benefit.<br>
		<br>
		We thank and support the following websites, people, and organizations for helping originate our articulation of our goals, our understandings of nature, and for solidarity:<br>
