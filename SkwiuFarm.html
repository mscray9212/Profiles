		<p>    Skwiu Farms is a non profit 501(c)3 Organization focused on enriching local communities, initially of the Raleigh / Durham / Chapel Hill triangle of North Carolina,
As well as surrounding areas near to the Piedmont of North Carolina through the creation of local cooperative markets based in high quality, Organic produce grown
Locally in the nearby areas.  Skwiu Farms strictly adheres to a non-synthetics in the garden policy, a non GMO policy, and we also focus on bringing foods of the Native
Indigenous Americans to the people in communities adjacent to our projects.  Skwiu Farms implements a hands on philosophy for education and outreach, bringing the best
of locally grown exotics and natives for a bio-diverse diet from our welcoming community.</p>

<p>    Skwiu Farms consists of many people from Permaculture designers, Artists, Jack of All Trades, Apprentices, and Scientists.  Our unifying force originates in
our shared common interest, which is the common interest to all people;  To have flourishing, and abundant food growing nearby, to ensure our healthfulness and
prosperity.  Our projects guarantee a mutually beneficial system for the soil microbes, and carbon sequestration from the atmosphere. We will utilize some known exotic
foods, such as Olives, but focus on maintaining a 60% minimum on native plant species.  Sections of Skwiu farms are allotted for the conservation of native plants, and
restoring the populations of native, and exotic, endangered plants.  We expect and openly welcome scientific researchers who want to study these plants, the soil,
and videographers or artists who want to document our experiences. We do not discriminate based on anything, however we expect that regardless of your age, you will
be able to find productive ways to work, teach, and share.</p>

<p>Our website is a platform through which people can understand more about what we do, have access to contact our organization to arrange accomodations for those staying.
We expect to have links available to some of our externally hosted galleries, as well as links to our friends in Permaculture, through various websites we support,
such as openpermaculture.org, permaculture.org.  We hope that people will be able to find links to suggest exotic plants, as well as native plants (that perhaps
we've missed or not gotten to yet), that we might keep open documentation of our progress.  We will be using the Google Drive, for most of our documents, and therefore
need only the capability to cross platform the links from our Google Drive onto the page, either displayed, or linked to.  We are keeping live documentation on the 
Internet of our inventory, growing and in seed, as well as notes about the growing progress, any pitfalls, and easy growing species that should be noted, with progress
on the account of restoration of endangered species' populations.</p>
